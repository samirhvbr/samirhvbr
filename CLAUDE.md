> **Language: everything that lands on GitHub is written in English.** Commit

> names, PR and issue titles and bodies, and Release notes. Decided in `0.1.2`:
> the profile page is read by a mostly international audience, so the repo should
> not switch languages between what it shows and how it is written. This is a
> deliberate deviation from the fleet default — the norm in `repodocs` is

## Releases — the `version.md` on GitHub is what the Releases show

> Marked echo. The single source is **[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/versioning.md)**
> — change it there, not here. This block is regenerated.

**The `version.md` of the default branch, on GitHub, is what the GitHub Releases
must show.** The local checkout does not enter the calculation: it can be behind,
ahead or mid-work, and none of that is published — GitHub cannot tag a commit it
does not have.

**The bump and the Release are one act.** A commit that bumps `version.md` is not
finished until that version has a tag, a published Release, and the **`Latest`
badge on it** — the same push, not "later". A badge sitting on an older release
tells whoever looks that the project is at a version it is not.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` does it on any push that touches `version.md`.
- `./tools/release.sh` does it by hand. It is **idempotent and self-healing**:
  it publishes whatever is missing and moves a drifted badge back. Running it is
  always safe, so it is both the check and the fix.

A PR publishes nothing while it is a PR. The moment it merges, the push moves
`version.md` on the default branch and the Release becomes that version.

Tag and Release title are the **bare version — no `v` prefix**.

## Language — English (US), everywhere in the repository

**Everything that lives in this repository, or in GitHub's interface around it,
is written in English (US)**: documents, **commit messages**, pull request titles
and bodies, issues, code comments, changelog entries, release notes.

Commit format: `X.Y.Z - short description in English`. The version comes from
`version.md` and is bumped in the same commit. Conventional Commits prefixes
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) and vague one-word messages are forbidden.

**Exactly one carve-out:** end-user-facing strings — UI text, transactional
email, product copy. That is product i18n for a Brazilian audience, not
repository content.

History is not rewritten: Portuguese messages already in the log stay as they
are.
