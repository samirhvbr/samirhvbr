## Releases — the `version.md` on GitHub is what the Releases show

> Marked echo. The single source is **[samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs/blob/master/docs/versioning.md)**

**The `version.md` of the default branch, on GitHub, is what the GitHub Releases
must show.** The local checkout does not enter the calculation: it can be behind,
ahead or mid-work, and none of that is published — GitHub cannot tag a commit it
does not have.

**The bump and the Release are one act.** A commit that bumps `version.md` is not
finished until that version has a tag, a published Release, and the **`Latest`
badge on it** — the same push, not "later". A badge sitting on an older release
tells whoever looks that the project is at a version it is not.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` does it on any push that touches `version.md`.
- `./tools/release.sh` does it by hand. It is **idempotent and self-healing**:
  it publishes whatever is missing and moves a drifted badge back. Running it is
  always safe, so it is both the check and the fix.

A PR publishes nothing while it is a PR. The moment it merges, the push moves
`version.md` on the default branch and the Release becomes that version.

Tag and Release title are the **bare version — no `v` prefix**.
